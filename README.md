# Othello_AI_Game

This program runs a game of Othello on an nxn board, where n can be changed within the code. It creates an environment where a person can play agaist an AI-based player on their system. 

I wrote the AI.py file, which uses possible moves and board configurations to decide which move to take next. Optimization on the search space is done using the MINIMAX algorithm, as well as alpha-beta pruining, caching, and heuristic methods.

To run, call python3 othello_gui.py Ai.py on your local system.
